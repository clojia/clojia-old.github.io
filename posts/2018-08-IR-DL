- Motivation
“Conventional machine-learning techniques were limited in their ability to process natural data in their raw form”, hence required expertise in feature engineering.

- Approach
Deep learning (i.e. multi-layer neural networks) was introduced, and it is able to discover “intricate structures in high-dimensional data”. Examples like CNN(convolutional neural networks) and RNN(recurrent neural networks) has achieved great performances in many domains such as imagine recognition, speech recognition, etc.

- Limitation
1. GPU
2. Labeled data
3. Unsupervised learning
