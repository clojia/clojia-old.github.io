A. Bendale and T. E. Boult. Towards open set deep networks.
In CVPR, 2016. 

[github](https://github.com/abhijitbendale/OSDN)

## Motivation

While deep networks have produced significant gains in computer vison field, it is easily fooled with images humans do not consider meaningful. i.e. It is normally difficult to recognize "unknown" aka.unlabeled problem, which is called open set. This paper introduced a algorithm OpenMax 

## Approach
- meta-recognition
- OpenMax

## Limitation 


## Problems
1. meta-recognition
2. Extreme Value Theory
3. (mean) activation vector
4. weibull parameter
5. penultimate layer
