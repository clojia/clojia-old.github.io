Hassen, M., Chan, P.K.: Learning a neural-network-based representation for open set recognition. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.04365 (2018)

## Motivation

Open set recognition problems, handling "unknown unknowns".

## Approach

Proposed loss function: ii-loss - aim to maximize the distance between different classes (inter class separation) and minimize distance of an instance from its class mean (intra class spread).
Proposed a simple threshold estimation technique.

## Limitation

more robust threshold estimation
batch normalization? (speed/cost)
